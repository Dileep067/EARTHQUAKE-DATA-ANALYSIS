## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) and contains global earthquake records over several decades.

**File Used:** `database.csv`

### Key Columns:
- `Date`, `Time` – Date and time of the earthquake
- `Latitude`, `Longitude` – Geographic location
- `Depth` – Depth in kilometers
- `Magnitude` – Magnitude of the quake
- `Type` – Type of seismic event (e.g., earthquake, explosion)
- `Status`, `Source`, `ID` – Metadata fields

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and processing
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

1. Load and explore the earthquake dataset
2. Clean unnecessary columns and handle missing values
3. Analyze and visualize earthquake statistics:
   - Frequency over time
   - Magnitude distribution
   - Depth trends
   - Earthquake types and statuses
   - Locations with high activity
4. Present insights with clear, simple graphs

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Magnitude distribution (histogram)
- Earthquake locations (scatter plot)
- Earthquakes over time (line plot)
- Earthquake count by type (bar chart)
- Depth vs Magnitude (scatter plot)
- Most common magnitudes (bar chart)
- Status breakdown (pie chart)

## 📝 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to perform basic data analysis on real-world geophysical data. Through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, we gain meaningful insights into earthquake patterns across time and geography. The simplicity of tools like Pandas and Seaborn makes it accessible even for beginners to visualize and interpret large-scale scientific data.
